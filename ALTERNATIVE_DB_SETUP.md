# Alternative Database Setup Options

Since direct database connection is having issues, here are alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Use Supabase Pooler Connection (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Database
3. Look for "Connection pooling" section
4. Enable "Session" mode pooling
5. Copy the "Connection string" from the Pooler section
6. Use port `6543` instead of `5432`

Your pooled connection string will look like:
```
postgresql://postgres.[project-ref]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

## Option 2: Skip Prisma Push and Use Existing Schema

Since your tables already exist in Supabase (we verified this), you can:

1. Generate Prisma Client without pushing:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

2. Start using the application with existing tables

## Option 3: Use Prisma Introspection

Pull the existing schema from Supabase instead of pushing:

```bash
npx dotenv -e .env.local -- prisma db pull
```

This will update your Prisma schema to match what's already in Supabase.

## Option 4: Check Network/Firewall

The connection error might be due to:
- Corporate firewall blocking port 5432
- WSL2 network configuration issues
- VPN interference

Try:
1. Temporarily disable VPN if using one
2. Check if port 5432 is open: `nc -zv db.myrmiimwgdwjldqvyfou.supabase.co 5432`
3. Try from a different network

## Quick Fix to Continue Development

Since the tables already exist, you can proceed with:

```bash
# Just generate the Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Start development
npm run dev
```

The application will work because:
- Supabase tables are already created ✅
- Prisma client can be generated locally ✅
- Authentication will use Supabase connection ✅
